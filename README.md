# Flinders API

This project scrapes the Flinders website and creates a database from publicly available data on the website.

The project makes some uses of the data, including signage software for Flinders University.

## API (TODO)

The API is designed to be RESTful, and enables simple access to the data scraped from the Flinders website by this application.

The supported formats of the API include JSON and XML.

## Signage (TODO)

The signage for the project is designed for usage on non-interactive internet-enabled screens, similar to the digital signs seen around Flinders University.

The signage is designed to be accessed via a web browser.

Much of the signage's data is dynamically pulled from Flinders university's public website, however 


## Scraping

The scraping of the Flinders website is a treacherous undertaking, because the website's HTML is inconsistent and not standards compliant. This project provides an API to save other developers from having to bother scraping the Flinders public website themselves, and hopefully enable other developers to make apps which use the data easily.

The API provided by this application should also help minimize the need to scrape the Flinders University website. Scraping is an expensive operation: pages must be unnecessarily generated by the Flinders website, as no raw data dumping is facilitated. By using FlindersAPI2's API, you won't be hitting the Flinders website, and will not create any load on Flinders' servers.
